# Profile and Posts

This is my profile website built using jekyll. I have used `basically-basic` theme and modified it to include my projects, posts and other information

## Run locally

- Make sure you install [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
- Clone the repo and run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- You can then visit `localhost:4000`
