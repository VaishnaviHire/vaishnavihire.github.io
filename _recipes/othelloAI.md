Othello is a perfect-information two person game. It is mostly attractive because of the simplicity of its rules. 

We developed an agent to play the othello game by implementing Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm and combined it with a custom heuristic function. 

## Description 

1. To evaluate our AI agent, the results of the following scenarios are noted and compared for evaluation.
   - Our agent play against itself but with different heuristic functions.
   - Our agent play against online heuristic based Othello game
2. The AI was continuously improved using these scenarios and heuristics were updated
3. The source code for the project is available at : [Github Link](https://github.com/VaishnaviHire/OthelloAI)
