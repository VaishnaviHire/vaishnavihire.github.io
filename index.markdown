My name is Vaishnavi. I am a graduate student from Northeastern University with interests in Software development and Natural Language Processing(NLP).

I love to build softwares that help people solve their problems. I have ardently worked on my software skills over the years by working as an intern with multiple organizations and developing challenging personal projects. Having lived in 5+ cities, I have experience of collaboration in diverse environments.

My future aspirations also include contributing to open source community. I have professional experience with Python, API design and cloud services like AWS and GCP. I am also familiar with programming languages like Java, Kotlin and technologies like git, Kubernetes and IBM Watson.

When I am not coding, you will find me reading books. Being a data enthusiast, `Factfulness` by Hans Rosling is one of my favorite books.

I look forward to connecting with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaishnavihire/) or you can email me at [Email](hire.v@husky.neu.edu)
